## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
- To ensure that code is functional, JUnit tests are a great way to do so. Testing a file fully at 100% and making sure that all tests have passed is a great way to ensure that the code will be functional when used. To ensure that code is secure there are multiple types of security testing techniques that can be implemented. Although not used in our projects in this course, security testing involves testing for vulnerabilities in software so that developers can fix the issue through coding. These threat risks and vulnerabilites can cause software to stop functioning or to be exploited so it is necessary to fix these before they can be exploited. 

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
- When creating a program, we must understand and consider the users which will be utilizing the program. As programmers we see and create the raw code of a program but to those not savvy to this knowledge it won't mean anything. Creating software that will translate into a simpler function of just clicking a button to make things happen is how we incorporate user needs into a program. For whatever program we create, we must consider creating all the functions needed for that program to carry out it's job, and that means having the users of that program have all the necessary tools of the program. 

## How do I approach designing software?
- My approach to designing software is cautious because I want to make sure I'm doing everything that is being asked of me. I still try to work quickly and efficiently but I want to ensure that what I'm creating software that is functional. I'm sure that my speed and understanding of software design will continue to improve constantly so my approach will change over time as I grow more confidence in my skills.
